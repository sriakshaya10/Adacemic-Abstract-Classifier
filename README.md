# Academic Abstract Classifier
**AI-Powered Research Paper Categorization Platform**

---

## Overview
**arXiv Paper Classifier** is a full-stack web application that automatically classifies research papers into academic domains using machine learning. Users submit a paper’s **title and abstract**, and the system predicts the most relevant research category with confidence scores.

The project integrates **modern frontend design**, **secure authentication**, **admin management**, and a **CatBoost-based machine learning model** into a single end-to-end system.
